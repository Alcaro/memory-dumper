<p>memory-dumper is a tool for dumping files from process's memory.
The main purpose is to find patterns inside the process's memory,
which is done by plugins, and dump segments of memory to files.</p>

<a name="why-would-i-use-memory-dumper" class="anchor" href="#why-would-i-use-memory-dumper"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why would I use memory-dumper</h1>

<p>Virtually memory-dumper can dump anything, it's up to you find it
any use. That said, I use it to dump Flash files (<code>SWF</code>). There are
many <code>SWF</code> encrypted files that can't be decrypted easily. The only
easy way is make them decrypt themself and them dump them directly
from memory.</p>

<p>New plugins for dumping any other type of data can be created
easily.</p>

<a name="ok-id-like-to-dump-xyz" class="anchor" href="#ok-id-like-to-dump-xyz"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ok, I'd like to dump <code>XYZ</code>
</h1>

<p>You just need to create a plugin! It's that easy. Just look inside
the plugin folder. Your plugin should have two main functions.
The first one is <code>init</code> which will be used to init the plugin
itself and pass it some useful functions; and the second one is <code>match</code>,
which is used to pass a memory block to the plugin so it can search
and dump it's content.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Currently memory-dumper works only on Linux. Maybe I'll port it to 
Windows at some point in the future, but I don't want to promise 
anything. Anyways, I'll accept a patch for this :)</p></li>
<li><p>I'm planning to write some more plugins. Probably a dumper for <code>PDF</code>
files. If you want a plugin for some specific data, use the <code>New issue</code>
button :)</p></li>
<li><p>Write some documentation about how to write a plugin.</p></li>
